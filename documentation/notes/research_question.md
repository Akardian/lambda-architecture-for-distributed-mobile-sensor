# Research Question

## Spark Processing Time

The lambda architecture is using two different data transforming layer. This is done to reduce the performance lose by processing large amounts of data. The question is at which point does the streaming layer drops in performance. Too Answer this we will compare the needed processing time of different "Apache Spark" application over time.
The data we are using for the experiment are, geographic coordinates and the WiFi strength at that location.
Both are going to be generated by a java program. The connection between the java program and spark is realised through the streaming platform "Apache Kafka".
